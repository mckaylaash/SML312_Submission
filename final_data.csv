3,wow youre the first to ever claim that apple is one bad quarter from having to worry about bankruptcy if i were you id be buying puts youd be rich no one in the industry is even worried about apple being bankrupt what info do you have 1 their financial statements do show that marketable securities they have nearly 60 billion in unrestricted cash if they needed access to it but they dont another 120 billion in longterm securities that again they have no reason to sell why do you focus solely on their liabilities and not their account receivables then of which other companies owe them nearly 30 billion same concept here 2 only made 34 billion 2020 their net income for q1 was 29 billion 2019 it was 22 billion only 34 billion they just recorded their most profitable year of 95 billion in net income last year previous high was 60 billion 275 billion in revenue for year 2020 365 billion in revenue for year 2021 this is a company that continues to grow 3 maybe you want to look at why apples debt is high hint its a strategy they leveraged low interest rates much like us bonds to finance their business because these rates are so low they earn more off their marketable securities than the rate of the interest on their debt also their money is mostly overseas so they avoid paying us corporate taxes by doing this its artificially high because apple was able to get basically lowinterest to use they have nearly 70 billion in debt that is costing them less than what inflation is charging imagine a scenario where you can either use 100 of your own money and earn 5 of interest on it or you can borrow 100 and only pay 2 you pocket the 3 difference why wouldnt you apple uses this debt to finance their rd structure buyback on their shares and pay dividends to investors again when used correctly debt is actually a good thing 4 companies already repair iphones all the time whether it is small businesses or some established iphone resellers online that isnt news i had my iphone repaired five years ago with generic parts youre making seem it seem as if this is new and will be a huge issue for apple in the grand scheme of things very few individuals are

2025 it is expected to be apples most profitable segment and reach 150 billion in revenue apple is diversifying away from their iphone hardware and are making significant rd improvements to wearables and ar technology btw if apple was worried about their shortterm debt they would decrease or eliminate their dividends they have been increasing it yearly they spent 86 billion to repurchase shares last year and paid out 15 billion on dividends in that same period since 2012 apple has spent nearly 500 billion buying back shares does this seem like a company that is worried about liquidity your

1,i was predicting a large pullbackrecession in 2022 all last year i was told its a bull run and with covid recovery and everything that a second large drop was near improbable so soon after etc now theyre saying we are in a recession and this is just the beginning im bullish long term eoy bearish short term i knew inflation would catch up with the wallets of americans especially as wages have stagnated or went up at a lesser rate than inflation for a large majority of americans furthermore i knew stimulus money was running out so as govt stopped buying bonds and civilians run out of their stim money foot traffic of retail would go down i honestly thought unemployment would be more of an issue due to wage demand as businesses have endured a lot of cost increases on top of so i figured hiring would slow or stop as managers cant afford workers they desperately need businesses have done a good job at trying to reach an equilibrium of passing costs off to consumers to allow for some wage hikes taking profit cuts but still maintaining margins now that inflation and wages are more directly impacting everyday americans theyve began to modify their budgets this is why feb retail foot traffic was down a lot as others have said we will see a quarter or two of misses from big companies like hd lowe wmt mcd amzn etc as analysts readjust their forecasts and companies review their forward looking earnings also supply chain issues now that inflation is being reeled in supply chains issues should ease more and more covid is ending and life is returning to a sense of normalcy i would say we are near the peak of our economic struggles the peak could last a while but id say were there i originally identified midyearjune area as a pivot point i assumed it would be the start of the pullback now im thinking it could pose as the potential bottom for us i could see russia finishing up its ukraine invasion by then and at this point we would have our first rate hike and be looking at the second one coming soon after a catalyst like war ending lowering inflation and baked in rates could be a good formula for a strong reversal ive identified 2 major support trend lines on the monthly chart a 4000 retest on sp is what im hoping forcurrently predicting for the bottom but max pain would be 3000 retest if it bounces off 4000 bullish again long as this used to be a resistance line so confirming it as new support would be strong 3000 support would be riding the tl that was respected by the 2020 crash which this area is a zone of consolidation and i find it hard to believe it would not act like a demand zone even moreso considering 3k is 60 from ath now 4000 is 20 from ath which seems more likely covid crash was 35 from ath only thing is now wed have a resistance line again and sp would be stuck in a range still bullish but less so i also like that these tls show psych levels as possible levels of reversal worst im seeing is the possibility we go relatively sideways rest of year bottom out at 3000 next year then reversal looking at yearly chart just like people told me it was a bull run i was wrong and a doomsdayer etc now theyre the ones

am good at this game but i am small fries and i make plenty of errors what i am really good at is mitigating risk and i am good at not listening to my gut believe me i wanted to jump on the high growth train too many times over the years and even last year but every time i analyzed it i just couldnt make sense of some of the companies and i dont trust revenue on its own consumer staples i am including soda and coffee in here gis ko pep kdp cag healthcare jnj pfe reits recently just buying healthcare and senior living stuff vtr nhi ohi financials v utilities aqn misc cyclical sbux cost price might be high right now dis the above is about 25 of my portfolio give or take it changes very little over the years though at some points in time i did also have a lot of fixed income obviously there are a lot more companies to pick from now one caveat i do time my purchases sort of basically i look for price correcting events within the safe companies and i buy when they are down and there is always a few which are down at any point in time for instance right now cag dis sbux and v are in a dip so those would be my current targets if i didnt already hold them there are many others just dont rush to buy wait for opportunities i really dont think this is timing the market but rather more like opportunity buying or simple value investing this is how everyone should start build this nest egg 1st so that you can learn how to trade stocks gain some confidence and down the line have a buffer for risk taking now if i take a risk and it blows up in my face i can laugh it off because i know that my family is still good financially how long it takes to reach that will be different for each person as you suspect this part of my portfolio will never make me rich on its own it is however low management very little dd required and thus frees my time for other things they also generate cash giving me passive income lowering risk even more dividends are great risk mitigation the rest of my portfolio is 25 big caps with decent growth and the remaining 50 is either cash or big risky positions with each taking 10 to 25 and even then my definition of risky is not the same as others for example i have almost no respect for revenue growth in tech or financials im ok with revenue for hard assets companies where something physical actually trades hand but not software

may be bought and sold through an account at a brokerage firm or by dealing directly with the us government new issues of treasury bills notes and bondsincluding tipscan be bought through a brokerage firm or directly from the government through auctions at the us treasury departments treasurydirect website the yield is determined by the auction the yield is whatever investors are willing to pay i believe more info here though the site is kind of confusing in simple terms what i understand is that the rate yield is determined at auction the us treasury uses an auction process to sell these securities and determine their rate or yield ive also heard the saying all the time that the feds are the buyers of last resort isnt that basically if the federal government is trying to sell say 100 billion dollars worth of 10 year treasuries at 235 and there only 80 billion dollars worth of buyers showing up the federal reserve buys up the other 20 billion youre referring to lender of last resort but that has nothing to do with government debt in the united states the federal reserve acts as the lender of last resort to institutions that do not have any other means of borrowing and whose failure to obtain credit would dramatically affect the economy actually theres no shortage of buyers for us government debt its what they call the riskfree rate it may not be a great yield but you get what you pay for you can park your money there and be nearly 100 its going to be safe in the event they couldnt issue enough bonds at auction the only logical thing would be for the yield to increase maybe they cant issue enough at 2 but they can at 4 you see afaik this is not an issue at all at the moment for the us government or any government really if theres no demand for the debt the yield goes up until it becomes worth someones while im not sure whats up with argentina right now if the banks can borrow money from the federal reserve at 05 and 1 year treasuries pays out 159 wouldnt the banks just borrow at 05 from the fed fund rate to buy 1 year treasuries bonds that pays out a higher rate i guess theres risk considerations to take into account in that the fed fund rate might actually increase beyond the 159 but if you got bankers who can gambling that it wont i guess its a profitable investment actually the federal funds rate is not direct borrowing from the federal reserve thats the discount rate but yes right now its 05 discount window loans must be collateralized and they often are with us treasuries so it wouldnt make much sense to hand over us treasuries in order to buy more us treasuries discount rate loans are only used to cover shortterm liquidity needs im not 100 on all of this but im at least 95 in the right direction particular areas where i may be lacking are treasury auctions and the discount window but again i think ive expressed the general idea sufficiently,hhmm I do not know bond get auction I think they re just sell as be like say the 10

auction the only logical thing would be for the yield to increase maybe they can not issue enough at 2 but they can at 4 you see afaik this be not an issue at all at the moment for the us government or any government really if there s no demand for the debt the yield go up until it become worth someone while I m not sure what s up with argentina right now if the bank can borrow money from the federal reserve at 05 and 1 year treasury pay out 159 would not the bank just borrow at 05 from the fed fund rate to buy 1 year treasury bond that pay out a high rate I guess there s risk consideration to take into account in that the fed fund rate might actually increase beyond the 159 but if you get banker who can gamble that it will not I guess its a profitable investment actually the federal fund rate be not direct borrowing from the federal reserve that s the discount rate but yes right now its 05 discount window loan must be collateralize and they often be with us treasury so it would not make much sense to hand over we treasury in order to buy more us treasury discount rate loan be only use to cover shortterm liquidity need I m not 100 on all of this but I m at least 95 in the right direction particular area where I may be lack be treasury auction and the discount window but again I think I ve express the general idea sufficiently,"['are', 'can', 'so', 'all',

1,if demand picked up for evs to the point of being the popular choice over night the corresponding materials would sky rocket theres no way an ev switch will happen in the next year i agree with this part it will be a slower transition than some weve seen in the past due to the large amounts of minerals needed although nowhere near the 1020 years that most people expect it to take at least not in europe china japankorea and american cities theres no way an ev switch will happen in the next year also wifi had no competition you either get wifi or you dont thats a bad example in my opinion want a car buy new buy gasoline look to take the bus or carpool occasionally this i completely disagree with though wifi also had competition cellular but it was slow and expensive and had limited capabilities the same can be said for evs the competition is ice but its slow expensive less safe worse for the environment has less cargo space you need to frequently stop for gas it has worse handling etc could probably name 10 more the point being ice is as much competition to evs as cellular was to wifi for home usage or flip phones were to smart phones the only downside evs have right now is a higher sticker price everything else its better for 95 of the people basically anyone who doesnt drive more than 300 miles on a daily basis edit as for price depreciation thats because quantity is low if everyone was buying ev new models would get pumped out old models would go on resale and prices would drop just as fast as gas arent ev batteries one of the most expensive parts in the entire car i dont know about you but ive replace more batteries in my life than any other car part thats not true at all if that was the case it would apply to all evs but its only the more premium evs like teslas and mercedes other evs have similar depreciation to ice or even worse eg the nissan leaf the biggest reason depreciation is lower is not demand but less wear evs can easily do 300000 miles on one set of brakes because you almost never use them except in the bad evs that have poor energy recuperation hence the difference between teslamercedes and gm or vw for example they have no gearbox oil or clutch or any of the thousands of moving parts in an engine basically the only thing that needs maintenance are the tires and ac as for batteries the ones youre referring to are nothing like the battery packs that power an ev teslas only lose about 1 in battery capacity per year which also flattens off over time they easily outlast the lifetime of the car especially if the owner doesnt unnecessary charge them over 80 except for the ones with lfp batteries where charging them to full is actually beneficial the only risk with batteries is having an ev with poor quality batteries like the nissan leafs these die after a few year and already lose 30 capacity before that time hence the 75 depreciation in just 5 years,if demand pick up for evs to the point of be the popular choice over night the correspond material would sky rocket there s no way an ev switch will happen in the next year I agree with this part it will be a slow transition than some we ve see in the past due to the large amount of mineral need although nowhere near the 1020 year that most people expect it to take at least not in europe china japankorea and american city there s no way an ev switch will happen in the next year also wifi have no competition you either get wifi or you do not that s a bad example in my opinion want a car buy new buy gasoline look to take the bus or carpool occasionally this I completely disagree with though wifi also have competition cellular but it be slow and expensive and have limit capability the same can be say for evs the competition be ice but its slow expensive less safe bad for the environment have less cargo space you need to frequently stop for gas it have bad handling etc could probably name 10 more the point being ice be as much competition to evs as cellular be to wifi for home usage or flip phone be to smart phone the only downside evs have right now be a high sticker price everything else its well for 95 of the people basically anyone who do not drive more than 300 mile on a daily basis edit as for price depreciation that s because quantity be low if everyone be buy ev new model would get pump out old model would go on resale and price would drop just as fast as gas be not ev battery one of the most expensive part in the entire car I do not know about you but I ve replace more battery in my life than any other car part that s not true at all if that be the case it would apply to all evs but its only the more premium evs like tesla and mercede other evs have similar depreciation to ice or even bad eg the nissan leaf the big reason depreciation be low be not demand but less wear evs can easily do 300000 mile on one set of brake because you almost never use they except in the bad evs that have poor energy recuperation hence the difference between teslamercede and gm or vw for example they have no gearbox oil or clutch or any of the thousand of move part in an engine basically the only thing that need maintenance be the tire and ac as for battery the one you re refer to be nothing like the battery pack that power an ev tesla only lose about 1 in battery capacity per year which also flatten off over time they easily outlast the lifetime of the car especially if the owner do not unnecessary charge they over 80 except for the one with lfp battery where charge they to full be actually beneficial the only risk with battery be have an ev with poor quality battery like the nissan leafs these die after a few year and already lose 30 capacity before that time hence the 75 depreciation

its the hedges public position they feed retail heres the truth hedges dont want you to know a successful trader realizes that holding a stock as it drops in value represents a loss just like not holding a stock as it rises does im always baffled by the recommendation of when prices are dropping that you should hold and that you only lose money if you sell if you consider not taking advantage of potential gains as being a loss than the truth is when a stock is in a downtrend and crashing you only lose money if you dont sell heres an easy example to demonstrate it you start with 1000 shares that are one dollar each and as the stock is falling you sell after 10 loss at 90 per share and you have 900 cash when the price drops all the way to 60 a share that 900 will purchase 1500 shares when the price of the stock recovers to one dollar your portfolio is now worth 1500 instead of the 1000 for the person who held on the way down and back on the way up even when you calculate capital gains at the highest short term rate of 40 you still end up way ahead and its important to note that doing this is not what the wash rule relates to the truth is that any time you sell and you repurchase at a lower price you realize owning more shares those additional shares translate into additional dollars when the share price rises 2 this is essentially poor man shorting people think you must buy low and then sell high to make money and they ignore 50 of the potential gains which are in the other direction sell high first and then buy low creates gains just the same but because retail investors only think in the long terms they dont realize that holding a stock as it drops is taking a loss they get really anxious about selling and then maybe the stock goes up which is not owning a stock as it rises but they dont see that holding the stock as it drops is just as bad buying dips and cost averaging down are terrible investing strategies considering the alternative mathematics simply suggest that if you sell in a downtrend you realize gains you can even increase your gains as illustrated in the 1000 share example if you employ a put buying strategy as it falls as well doing that yields even more than the 1500 shares in the previous example so the secret is to know when the reversal is happening because the word dip implies coming back up but what people called buying on the dip is just buying on a downtrend 3 i wasnt involved in the kodak buying fiasco but i helped a friend who was by directing him to sell immediately in that crazy july 2020 day and he was lucky to get 32 and he paid 56 but by buying puts with that 32 as it continued to trend down all the way to seven dollars he actually ended up with larger gains then had it just stayed up at 62 so im not sure why the conventional wisdom during a crash is to not panic sell when thats exactly the move to take to minimize losses and maximize gains and the thing that causes people to not employ the strategy is their fear that if they sell instead of dropping it will rise and yet they have no problem with holding the stock as it drops in price and theyre both equally bad,imo that be a lie the hedge fund disseminate for their advantage be you only lose if you sell and in a crash do not panic sell you see so call expert suggest this idiocy in forbe magazine etc its the hedge public position they feed

2,your argument is that it would hurt us more than them all i am saying is that this is not true and its 100 based on unfounded fears all it will do to the usa is inconvenience us for a couple of years other nations will actually be happy as hell because it means they have a shot at getting chinas business i mean seriously think about it covid was worse than what would happen if we get out china literally much worse because it actually killed people and stopped production of non essential stuff which is exactly what would happen if we sanctioned china we simply cut off nonessential goods but no one would die and certainly there would be other places to get said nonessential toys we would just lose some money and then bounce back in other words covid was worse and we survived that just fine our current problems are actually very petty oh no inflation i might have to forgo my iphone for a year and eat ground beef twice a week instead of prime rib and oh no i may have to work from home more to save on gas oh the horror we are so weak we need to stand up and stop being so lame look im not a republican im no democrat either so none of this is political for me this is a childhood of dealing with bullies and being competitive we need to stick up for ourselves against a economic opponent who is clearly manipulating things in their own favor to the detriment of our country this is obvious right i hope so thus even if it hurts us we still need to do what needs to be done thats called being an adult if china becomes like russia and starts attacking taiwan or even backing russia in ukraine we need to hit them with sanctions there should be exactly zero hesitation none forget apples profits forget the iphone thats just childish bs further like i said above it would most assuredly destroy chinas economy because unlike us they have too many people and not enough jobs they are 100 reliant on western countries buying their goods we on the other hand have jobs but not enough people guess which problem is easier to solve as for the trade war it isnt working because we didnt address the real problem and thats our own companies if you want to bring back jobs then you need to tax our own companies for exporting none of the other crap will work tariffs and such are like trying to treat a heart attack with a bandage its not going to work because we dont control china nor should we try to but we sure as hell can control the profits made here in the usa so the solution is to hit the corporations who export jobs not to attack china itself basically just do what china does tilt the table in our favor here in the usa there are many ways to do this but alas what i said above corporations like the extra profits and they control our politicians,your argument be that it would hurt we more than they all I be say be that this be not true and its 100 base on unfounded fear all it will do to the usa be inconvenience we for a couple of year other

how can you fail at crypto currency at a time even a meme dog coin was succeeding cuz its trust we just said elon has dogey and bam everyone bought dogecoin facebook had tons of banks big companies advance coders and backers and nope no way anyone will give any info to facebook or trust facebook in any way or form so the writing is on the wall imo facebook will eventually go out along w boomers and instagram will soon loose to tiktok instagram has also become this toxic narcisistic platform and kids are not adopting it facebook is the platform that does better with ads apples side swap it w privacy and now its going to hurt more imoz so instead of addressing the issue it has zuck is escaping to the cheesy holodeck facebook could have had a shopify type of business page and other great stuff but so far its more like yahoo side services that no one uses or cares about bloating the system they could mention ways to have advertisers feel that their ads will work w some change in the back end to go around apples and googles privacy and even have ways to make news outlets and groups to be held more accountable for toxic posts so its a better platform for the masses and kids no one knows facebook has google like video section again just hidden in its bloated side apps just like yahoo so wo looking at numbers or doing complex company profiles etc its just a thing eventually it will caught to meta and that headset meta reality thing will be met by apples version where just like previous cool new gadgets apple will do its apple thing and wait to see whats the way to make real money out it by thinking of the masses not what a secluded rich white techy nerd thinks my prediction is that eventually one or two earnings reports will make it seem like a good biz to invest but

3,at least 4 of these are either false or they are honestly very likely to change in the future or be rendered to the sidelines and within several decadesat the most the main demographic of reddit will honestly likely see the scenario of the murican empire failing 1 murica is the most corrupt of all countries you just dont call it corruption because its legalized therefore corruption only appears to be lower on a technicality the reality is that political lobbying is corruptiondont know a single person who actually knows a thing or two about how the government works that thinks otherwise political lobbying has caused so much awful harm and damage to both the murican people and the rest of the world murica should have far less poverty far less crime and far higher standard quality of life for its citizens yet it doesnt why because the ultra wealthy and corporations can legally bribe our corrupt leadership into doing only whats selfishly beneficial to the very top of the wealth pyramid and not what actually benefits the whole country 2 all it takes is for the usd to be dethroned as the petro dollar and we are in serious trouble and thats a reality thats becoming more and more possible even a mere 1015 years ago this wouldve been absolutely unthinkable and youd be laughed into infinity just recently the saudis have literally threatened that exact scenario that they will trade oil for something other than the dollar granted it was an empty threat but the fact that they actually even spoke it out loud indicates that times are changing again even 10 years ago they wouldnt so much as dare to merely think such thoughts now theyre saying it out loud to the whole world tomorrow will not get better in this regard 3 military dominance is both likely to end within our lifetimes and is actually a very bad thing please look at literally every single country nation and group of humans that have ever existedever and notice that they all eventually declined in military power to the point of obscurity murica will not break this law of humanity if you actually believe that murican military dominance will continue until the end of time and space itself than you are a mentally ill crazy person simple as that also the massive military spending is precisely one of the reasons why the murican people again have much shittier safety nets infrastructure crime problems poverty levels low education rates etc we should be totally dominating in all those areas like literally nobody should he even close in any of those things murica quite frankly should be the equivalent of those memes you see about the world if xyz wouldve been different and you see a highly advanced futuristic utopia instead we lag behind virtually all of the other players in our league of first world countries in all those measures why because we waste yes thats right it really is a waste a metric fuckload of money on military dominance instead of actually improving our country 4 industry dominance again this is likely to end within our lifetimes everybody knows about taiwan and tsmc and the superconductor control they have and guess what taiwan was a complete shithole ran by an evil dictatorship of the kmt and chiang kaisheks legacy until the 80s or so yes thats right it really was an evil dictatorship please do some actual learning maybe go to taiwan and do some learning in a respected taiwanese university oh you cant be bothered to do that cool read some fucking history then on taiwan now think about how within hardly 30 years taiwan went from like 1 step above the dystopia of sub saharan africa to being one of the dominant forces in technology south korea did the same basically a complete and utter shithole ran by an evil dictatorshipyes thats right they werent really all that much different from the norks until aboutthe 80s yet they rose to being a first world country basically and in like 20 years or so a veryyyyy short amount of time india is also on the rise and historically speaking india has been one of the strongest civilizations throughout all of history just because the british assholes did their british thing of being an gigantic fucking evil asshole to yet another country with darker skin than waspy british assholes and temporarily tripped up the indians doesnt mean that theyll stay down forever theyre also reclaiming their original spot as one of the great civilizations of the earth however slow or fast you think that will happen is not really all that important they will catch up and prolly surpass us in due time lastly you guys do realize that even by your very own analysis right here youve managed to argue against yourself half the fortune 500 companies are founded by immigrants like you said and do you want to know what this actually means if you take off the attitude of arrogance it means that youre not actually dominating anything it was nonamericans who did all the real work and youre just taking the credit because it just so happened that all these not american people made success on american soil and since american dominance is actually not murican at all it means that all it takes is for another country to be more attractive to high value individuals and outsiders for murica to fall back down to what only muricans can achieve which by your very own statements here would mean that massive portions of murican success would disappear i mean faang companies and the father of boeing alone prove that its really just a buncha asians and indians doing all the real work while murcians take all the credit because theyre in leadership positions this is a hard to swallow pill for many prolly all of you tbh but its the truth and since all of you are about to argue and most of you will just do some downvoting or maybe a sarcastic one liner or so that doesnt help the conversation at all let me leave you with this question to ponder have you ever had the self awareness to realize that the murican

1,teslas stock would go up if the cars kept selling well enough at the tripled price of course it seems an unlikely scenario that they would keep selling well because yes the demand for goods tends to drop as the price goes up but there is an issue of how much the price needs to go up to have a meaningful impact on demand the demand for a tesla car is generally more elastic than the demand for oil if tesla cars tripled in price and ford cars didnt that would likely have a severe impact on the demand for tesla cars as people quickly switch to fords and the price of tesla stock would likely crater even if both tesla and ford cars tripled in price demand for their cars would likely drop because most people would nurse their old cars along and wait to upgrade while the price of oil is soaring the price of its main competitor natural gas is also soaring further other related power sources wind solar hydro nuclear are not able to increase production right now to fill in any gaps in demand so while some buyers do simply shut down operations in the face of the high prices most continue to buy this drives margin expansion where the oil and gas companies and the companies selling other power sources all book higher percentages of profit for each dollar of energy sold this is very bullish for their stocks of course there is also a question of how long these prices stay elevated right now oil and gas drillers in the us are looking a year ahead in the futures market and they arent confident these prices will still be here a year from now if high energy prices actually last less than a year then the stock prices of energy companies might already have gotten a little high for further thought exxon xoms profitability as seen in their quarterly ebitda margin sat between 10 and 155 from the start of 2015 through the end of 2019 then covid dropped demand and exxons ebtida margin slipped to average 92 for 2020 it then came back rather quickly to average 166 in 2021 at the same time as exxons ebitda margin fell its top line fell with revenue in 2020 at 74 of what it averaged from 2015 through 2019 and in 2021 revenue jumped to 14 above its 20152019 average taken together the hits to the top line and margins drove a 49 drop in exxons ebitda in 2020 compared to the 20152019 average and yet the 2021 recovery saw ebitda swing to 41 higher than the same average so to really dig into the question of investing in the oil patch today involves questions of how long the price of oil will stay high and how high that is and it gets tied up to some degree in questions of substitution there is a lot of lead time in bringing new supplies of any energy online to me shrug i dont know but i guess well see energy prices roughly as high as they are today 9 months from now but i guess they will have dropped from these levels by 2 or 3 years from now i guess this is temporary if you consider 2 or 3 years temporary the drillers seem concerned the oil price jump peters out in under 1 year this makes perfectly good sense when looking at the oil futures where the price is expected to drop slowly but steadily check out the cme light sweet crude quotes my thought very uninformed by comparison is it peters out in 2 or 3 years what does it look like stock investors think well exxons stock price is right around its average from 2015 through 2019 looks reasonable enough at first glance,teslas stock would go up if the car keep sell well enough at the triple price of course it seem an unlikely scenario that they would keep sell well because yes the demand for good tend to drop as the price go up but there be an issue of how much the price need to go up to have a meaningful impact on demand the demand for a tesla car be generally more elastic than the

2,1 there are multiple brokerages you can make an account with online so no you dont have to go to a bank to open an account several options are td ameritrade fidelity etrade robinhood webull those last two are more for options trading though which is a risky trading type that you really dont want to get involved with unless you really build up your education on it even then you could lose potentially all of your money you just go to any of their websites or apps and apply to start an account 2 you can lose money with any investment you make going back to what i said above stock options trading is the most riskiest investment you can get involved with so i would stay far away from that as a new person to investing as a beginner you should really start with just buying and holding stocks thats the least riskiest because even if it loses value you only lose that money if you sell at a loss you should really only trade what you can afford to lose overall 3 it depends on how much you invest pretty much you can only make several thousand if a you are investing thousands already into the stocks you buy and b if you hold it for long term like years and your stocks appreciate in value a great deal in that timeframe or which is highly unlikely and i would not at all suggest you have this mindset you get randomly lucky and the stocks you invest in shoot up suddenly 4 again it depends on what kind of trading you want to do if you are just looking to buy and hold stocks or even better etfs no you dont need to monitor it too often if youve invested into solid stocks or etfs you can just let them appreciate in value naturally over the years if you want to be aggressive and frequently buy and sell shares which is extremely risky then yes you would have to monitor it frequently but as a beginner i do not at all recommend this its called day trading and its really risky i would make changes to investments only if you are losing value in whatever you have invested in and it doesnt look likely to gain value in the time frame you wanted to sell it in if you wanted to sell it at all if youre not looking to sell then i would just keep your stocksetfs and let them appreciate over time since over the long hall the market tends to go up 5 for a beginner i would definitely first do as much research and education as possible on stockbuying and do what youre doing now which is to ask questions when you feel you have the knowledge you need and you make an account i would first start looking at buying etfs etfs basically give you small amounts of shares in major lowrisk companies they will cover pretty safe stocks like amzn googl msft weve been in an extremely volatile market the past couple of years and so the prices you see for each stock may not be what you would typically see the safest thing you can do right now i think is just buy into some etfs and let the market run its course,1 there be multiple brokerage you can make an account with online so no you do not have to go to a bank to open an account several option be td ameritrade fidelity etrade robinhood webull those last two be more for option trading though which be a risky trading type that you really do not want to get involve with unless you really build up your education on it even then you could lose potentially all of your money you just go to any of their website or app and

change to investment only if you be lose value in whatever you have invest in and it do not look likely to gain value in the time frame you want to sell it in if you want to sell it at all if you re not look to sell then I would just keep your stocksetfs and let they appreciate over time since over the long hall the market tend to go up 5 for a beginner I would definitely first do as much research and education as possible on stockbuying and do what you re do now which be to ask question when you feel you have the knowledge you need and you make an account I would first start look at buy etfs etfs basically give you small amount of share in major lowrisk company they will cover pretty safe stock like amzn googl msft we ve be in an extremely volatile market the past couple of year and so the price you see for each stock may not be what you would typically see the safe thing you can do right now I think be just buy into some etfs and let the market run its course,"['open',

seen in recent months growth isnt over but for all the people looking through the rubble i think you have to be extremely selective its not no growth its what are your best highest quality growth ideas going forward i think that people have to have some allocation towards real assetsinflation protection the era of the best game in town is a portfolio that looks like a hyper growth fund feels like its overregime change some things got left behind when growth took off again in spring 2021 i think theres going to be a lot more things that ultimately are left behind next time and some talked up names from 20202021 will probably never see highs again if this environment goes on long enough theres probably going to be a few 20202021 ipos that are 0s at this rate kkrs recent 32 page macro outlook is imo a worthwhile and interesting read in terms of their views on positioning going forward pdf link i think theres a lot of useful information in that presented in a way makes for imo an enjoyable read a few highlights our bottom line both equities and credit represent good but not great value at current levels specifically we see midsingle digit returns across both asset classes equities in particular are a good inflation hedge and companies with high cash flow conversion and rising dividend yields should outperform in the environment we envision given these views we think that in many instances portfolio construction and asset allocation need to be rethought in particular we believe that the recent success of the traditional 6040 asset allocation benchmark will be seriously challenged in the macroeconomic environment we envision as such we advocate shortening duration leaning into collateralbased cash flows and overweighting opportunistic vehicles we also suggest increasing diversification by allocating across more strategies including some noncorrelated ones at the same time we continue to directionally steer away from high beta growth equities with low cash flow conversion prospects ultimately though we believe investors need to remain flexible as author john c maxwell wrote be stubborn about your vision but flexible with your plan looking at the bigger picture we think we are entering another uncertain period driven by tightening financial conditions a new form of war that includes both military action and unprecedented for an economy of russias size economic sanctions and more supply chain disruptions driven in part by a surge of omicron cases in china the technical picture too is also important as many investors are still overweight high beta growth and tech stocks which remains one of our pans see picks and pans in a different kind of recovery as such we continue to advocate that asset allocators prioritize inflation protection by overweighting collateralbased cash flows including infrastructure assetbased finance and real estate we also expect high cash flow conversion private equity and opportunistic credit to perform well,I would lean towards it be a bounce and the magnitude of bear market rally can be considerable I say last year that 2020 be the good period for growth since the dot com era but that it would not be sustain 2021 you see a large rotation out early in the year but people pile back in in the spring when it become apparent there be another variant that say if you look some growth name generally low quality do peak in february 2021 incl arkk and be leave behind when it take off again later in 2021 growth start to gradually crumble and then as the year come to a close the erosion accelerate

3,well youre kind of framing it as though theres a conversation that needs to be had that isnt being had and i dont think that could be further from the truth i dont know what the climate is like in spain but i generally follow the us canada and germany the us current political map is one that im sure youre familiar with democrats talk about issues such as the cost of university which some have proposed solving by cancelling student loan debts republicans complain about dying industries and the lack of options for workers expelled from them corruption and inequality has led to episodes such as drinking water chock full of lead an overused and abused prisoncriminal justice system predatory loans and insurance systems of several types and virtually every other social problem you can think of in canada theres a lot of fresh bitterness because theyre suddenly in a position where a lot of industries are either oligarchies such as their telecom industry or have been protected too much for too long with no way out such as the dairy industry they have a prime minister in a minority government who is unpopular and seen as corrupt and unwilling to tackle those problems canada recently had an election where the results were almost identical to that of the previous election and it was bemoaned as an election with no good candidates to vote for and thus a complete waste of time and money the healthcare system which is heavily valued by many people in canada is utterly incompetent in some parts of the country it can take months to see a doctor and over a year to see a specialist and some provinces are quickly headed towards privatization which im sure is about to be met with the fiercest opposition and yet no good solutions in the coming year housing costs are insane as a of income see and particularly in the two largest cities toronto and vancouver and the government has done very little to curb foreign or investment ownership the situation in germany is a bit better the issues that exist in the us dont exist nearly to the same degree there though issues such as housing for the high percentage of renters are certainly also present the recent election was a moment of optimism for most of the country in which a lot of people felt represented the governing cdu was left out of government while the progressive greens centerleft spd and freemarketsocially liberal fdp now make up a coalition government this alleviates the frustrations of people who felt a lack of progress under merkel notably the altright afd has lost significant ground however current events in ukraine have given way to a moment of reckoning in some ways at the perfect time given the fresh government and have pushed dependence on russia stalled progress on clean energy and other root issues to the forefront it is a moment of national embarrassment for a country that already experiences chronic historical embarrassment which is entrenched in education and pop culture there is significant desire to welcome refugees and to become independent on russia but the latter in particular just isnt a quick fix and would require a transition that will take several years this all to say that the discussion is happening in fact its the discussion and one that will dictate the next decade perhaps the next century of western politics but political unrest often starts with polarization and deadlock as the germans can tell you in these situations the problem is clear and there is a common desire to fix it and yet society is so broken into factions that nobody gets anywhere the us is the strongest example of this i dont think theres any lack of desire for change but getting conservatives and progressives to present a united front particularly in a paytoplay system where politicians openly receive donations and privileges in exchange for their adherence to the interests of the ruling class is nearly impossible what breaks that deadlock is either a one side getting enough of an edge to break the deadlock which the republicans seem to be much better positioned to do right now or b a fullscale political overhaul where the powers that be are overthrown things dont always go down in flames the way we imagine revolutions and uprisings quite often its a slow burn and a gradual bumpy decline which the us is arguably undergoing at the moment,well you re kind of frame it as though there s a conversation that need to be have that be not be have and I do not think that could be far from the truth I do not know what the climate be like in spain but I generally follow the us

3,no problem thanks for the detailed reply i would love to live in a country with high taxes and equality and everyone getting an equal shake but i have doubts on the feasibility of such things i live in a state california with high taxes that says they support helping people and promoting equality and they tax me oodles but for the most part my taxes dont seem to solve the problems they say they are going to fix my taxes go up the problems get worse we have crime homelessness pollution and corruption of our politicians three of my city council members have been indicted on federal corruption and bribery charges in the last 3 years interesting take i too wonder if such a thing is even feasible but i think its worth considering alternatives no scandinavia is famous for having a more equitable and wellfunctioning welfare state uncle sam subsidizing fabs will not solve the problem of meat being too expensive for most people and farm subsidies wont help either because we already have those housing well here in california we have streamlined the permitting process to get more housing built but for the most part its just more luxury housing that most people cant afford i do think supply chain issues will resolve but i dont think its something the government can fix unfortunately its my understanding that a lot of these subsidies are politically motivated the politicians are under the control of the lobbies you dont want blanket subsidies motivated by special interest but rather you want investments in the future drivers of growth in our economy semiconductors is a great example renewable energy would be another of course these numbers are precovid which only exacerbated our debt problems i hope and think you agree that these types of budget deficits and our debt are a threat to the long term stability of the united states and the global economy yes i agree that its a problem heres a good albeit old article from joseph stiglitz you dont want to slash social spending across the board because at the end of the day that leaves us worth off what you want to do is slash spending on useless subsidies for special interest even if you dont radically cut into the deficit you can eat into it slightly or at the very least slow it also you want to raise taxes more than what biden has proposed as for defense spending i would not be an advocate of slashing it completely but youd have to question some of our decisions to be the world police and what not in that regard i think trump not a fan of him in most areas was on to something i cant really elaborate on this area more than that im not too terribly worried about inequality being a structural issue of the economy it seems to me it always has been a part of the economy and only begins to become a problem when people start revolting en masse overqualified workers the main issue at my work is finding enough qualified workers more immigrants please skillset mismatch i dont see how structurally that is something that could take down the economy and easy monetary policy well we are tightening that up right now and i am thankful for it but i dont know if you understand the issues that inequality poses its always been a part of the economy but its getting worse and unequal countries tend to be worse off think mexico and brazil theres a reason for that when much of the country is poor aggregate demand falls people spend less and whats more innovation stagnates part of the reason the us has been responsible for driving the world forward in terms of technology is because it has the best educated population in the world but with inequality on the rise that could change finally theres always the issue of social unrest overqualified workers means people who should be working at a firm or other more serious job are working at starbucks thats not the kind of employment we want actually i just looked at some sources and its not that big of an issue in the usa right now apparently in spain where i live however this is most certainly the case as for skillset mismatch this is the whole reason that trump won in 2016 the old skilled laborers who used to be able to make a decent middle class living in auto factories and the like have been replaced by globalization these people havent been properly trained for new forms of employment and their standard of living has gone down while their unease with the current situation has gone up this makes a candidate like trump ripe for an election victory and also generally means our economy is operating less efficiently than it could easy monetary policy is no free lunch its good that were tightening up but lets see if its actually sustainable this is just a summation of my views and by no means an exhaustive analysis of everything more data would be needed for that im basing a lot of my views off of stiglitzs book the price of inequality where he does analyze the data and present the facts in depth,no problem thank for the detailed reply I would love to live in a country with high taxis and equality and everyone get an equal shake but I have doubt on the feasibility of such thing I live in

2,i agree with most of the points your brought up but i would like to address them to see if im missing something astr is absolutely a high risk high beta play i agree with you there either the company succeeds and goes cash flow positive or it wont i agree that the last failure was due to a dumb reason i also understand spacex blew up their first falcon 1 and kinda their 3rd as well for a similar dumb reason any company that is attempting to innovate and accepts failures is going to make dumb mistakes spacex succeeded because they iterated rapidly and fixed mistakes im not as worried with the failure seeing how rapidly they fixed and returned to flight i was a little bulky in my wording of when the failures in lv0007 and lv0009 occurred my point was that they were close enough to cause enough people to freak out that the stock tanked for an hour or so i disagree with you on astr not seeing increased business soyuz frequently included ridesharing that is going to need to find a new ride to share rklb will certainly see more business and if the rideshare is small enough to fit in an astr rocket i think they will too at the very least they may have some more pricing power you are correct in that a full size satellite mission on soyuz will need a f9 ride now but even that market pressure may result in less ride share rides on spacex as far as government funding i think the contracts will continue if they continue successfully launching my entire point that i can see regarding the military and astr is that the nsa or cia may at times want to launch a small satellite over a very specific orbit on a compressed timeline if that need arises astr would be well positioned if they are otherwise executing as for the compressed timeline i was thinking more about time from first phone call to launching i understand that other rocket companies can take one of their ready to use rockets and stack it quickly the issue is that most rides are booked far out im thinking of astr churning out rockets weekly for under a million their goal is 250k being able to get closer to a launch on demand ecosystem as far as point to point demand who knows maybe at some point there will be a high demand maybe the military decides to build out the capacity for some reason i just look at it as a possible growth path nothing more i completely agree with you that rklb is better positioned and more stable i only brought them up to show that i no longer look at it as one or the other just as spacex abandoned the small satellite launching business when they moved from f1 to f9 i think they will place much less emphasis on f9 once starship is running outside of keeping f9 going for its human rating i just cant see them wasting any resources on expanding f9 elon wants to go to mars f9 was a vitally important stepping stone i heard from the rklb ceo that neutron will be able to handle 80 of the current f9 manifests if they pull that off they will do quite well honestly im hoping one of these companies does well using otm calls lets me buy in at low cost and risk far less than buying shares astrs price has been beaten down over the last year but it seems like it might have hit a bottom im hoping a good earnings call and a few successful launches brings some life back into the share price even at its current price i think its worth taking a look at for a small speculative position rocket 3 has the technical ability to launch from anywhere baring permitting issues having said that the ability to ship an orbital class rocket anywhere with a standard shipping container and launch with 5 people is cool its a technical ability that others do not have it will be up to astr to capitalize on that by securing more launch sites,I agree with most of the point your bring up but I would like to address they to see if I m miss something astr be absolutely a high risk high beta play I agree with you there either the company succeed and go cash flow positive or it will not I agree that the last failure be due to a dumb reason I also understand spacex blow up their first falcon 1 and kinda their 3rd as well for a similar dumb reason any company that be attempt to innovate and accept failure be go to make dumb mistake spacex succeed because they iterate rapidly and fix mistake I m not as worry with the failure see how rapidly they fix and return to flight I be a little bulky in my wording of when the failure in lv0007 and lv0009 occur my point be that they be close enough to cause enough people to freak out that the stock tank for an hour or so I disagree with you on astr not see increase business soyuz frequently include ridesharing that be go to need to find a new ride to share rklb will certainly see more business and if the rideshare be small enough to fit in an astr rocket I think they will too at the very least they may have some more pricing power you be correct in that a full size satellite mission on soyuz will need a f9 ride now but even that market pressure may result in less ride share ride on spacex as far as government funding I think the contract will continue if they continue successfully launch my entire point that I can see regard the military and astr be that the nsa or cia may at time want to launch a small satellite over a very specific orbit on a compress timeline if that need arise astr would be well position if they be otherwise execute as for the compress timeline I be think more about time from first phone call to launch I understand that other rocket company can take one of their ready to use

3,bought at a good time and within our means and paid it off in 7 years so no mortgage just an hoa fee but that also covers water and trash and all outdoor stuff plus the roof and most insurance for pipe leaks and stuff i wouldnt trade back to having a mortgage just to have one i will prob have a small one payments under 1200 when we finally upgrade to a larger house i know mathematically it may make sense to take on a loan and invest at a higher rate than your mortgage but i dont believe that investing and life are really just math for example when covid hit we didnt flinch at an income hit because the worst that was going to happen was our internet would be canceled if we didnt pay our bills but our emergency fund was enough that we could have hunkered down for 3 years without income if all we had to pay was the very basics our expenses could be well under 1000month total if we needed it to be for a time loss of income timed with sharp drop in investment value and it might leave people overstretched playing the math game its not unlikely that the investments may not be there to cash out to carry you through the crisis i would prefer not to use credit cards either but my husband wont keep track of expenses and rather than giving him access to the debit card i just pay off the credit card each month its not my ideal way as i still consider short term debt that i have enough cash to cover to be a negative thing ive also had family emergencies a newborn in the hospital for 6 months and we were not financially stable then we had a lot of debt and juggled paycheck to paycheck it was rough i did not get to spend enough time with him and i did not get to take off enough time to process or grieve if god forbid something like that happened again it would be very different with the ability to put our lives on hold and prioritize differently without the very real fear of becoming homeless in the meantime we also wouldnt have to try to sell off investments etc plus not having a mortgage opens up hundreds of dollars to save or spend each month without other debt your mortgage prob wont last a full 15 years and then you can have shit tons of money to invest paying down the mortgage is also a sort of tangible goal that you can watch the number go down and get motivated to pay it faster as the number shrinks unless you are buying like g em ee or a stock youre motivated about you probably arent hustling hard to throw extra money at investments vs going w a predetermined flowplan motivation to finish off that mortgage can really spur things along we paid most of our mortgage value over 60 in the last 3 years vs the first 4 and got out of our loan 8 years early so im not sure how much extra beneficial it is to carry a mortgage much longer than you would otherwise if you just killed it on the mortgage in 8 years instead of 15 then the amount you can invest is huge and youll probably make up the mathematical difference in keeping a mortgage and buying investment or itd be so close in amount that the stress of overextending for the tax benefit wasnt worth it all those years anyway thanks for coming to my ted talk,buy at a good time and within our mean and pay it off in 7 year so no mortgage just an hoa fee but that also cover water and trash and all outdoor stuff plus the roof and most insurance for pipe leak and stuff I would not trade

could be well under 1000month total if we need it to be for a time loss of income time with sharp drop in investment value and it might leave people overstretch play the math game its not unlikely that the investment may not be there to cash out to carry you through the crisis I would prefer not to use credit card either but my husband will not keep track of expense and rather than give he access to the debit card I just pay off the credit card each month its not my ideal way as I still consider short term debt that I have enough cash to cover to be a negative thing I ve also have family emergency a newborn in the hospital for 6 month and we be not financially stable then we have a lot of debt and juggle paycheck to paycheck it be rough I do not get to spend enough time with he and I do not get to take off enough time to process or grieve if god forbid something like that happen again it would be very different with the ability to put our life on hold and prioritize differently without the very real fear of become homeless in the meantime we also would not have to try to sell off investment etc plus not have a mortgage open up hundred of dollar to save or spend each month without other debt your mortgage prob will not last a full 15 year and then you can have shit ton of money to invest pay down the mortgage be also a sort of tangible goal that you can watch the number go down and get motivate to pay it fast as the number shrink unless you be buy like g em ee or a stock you re motivated about you probably be not hustle hard to throw extra money at investment vs go w a predetermined flowplan motivation to finish off that mortgage can really spur thing along we pay most of our mortgage value over 60 in the last 3 year vs the first 4 and get out of our loan 8 year early so I m not sure how much extra beneficial it be to carry a mortgage much long than you would otherwise if you just kill it on the mortgage in 8 year instead of 15 then the amount you can invest be huge and you ll probably make up the mathematical difference in keep a mortgage and buy investment or it d be so close in amount that the stress of overextend for the tax benefit be not worth it all those year anyway thank for come to my ted talk,"['so', 'on', 'go', 'em', 'back', 'plus', 'game', 'can', 'all', 'fund', 'math', 'way', 'cash', 'loan', 'good', 'real', 'it',

way there were a lot of factors at play last week triple witching futures contracts rolling and expiring fed rate decision march madness yes that plays a part you can literally see the volume drop off when games start bc the street loves basketball and the traders stop working to watch and there were no major developments in putins assault on ukraine the market was a bit oversold so a bounce was expected but dont fool yourself the big money wasnt buying the broad market its only retail talking about the market bottom being in in any bear marketcycle there are good rallies just like in bull markets there are decent dips these rallies are mainly retail buying and shorts covering you have to keep in mind that for every buyer there is a seller so who was selling this week remember the big guys werent buying so they were probably selling despite what you read on bloomberg or cnbc selling to retail traders who are dumb and who will turn into sellers when the market drops further lining

hohum places they will not start buying the broad market esp growth areas until the headwinds have dissipated and that could be months and months out the buy the dip mentality that worked so well over the last two years will not serve you well over the next two be smart with your and dont try to front run the big players do you really think retail has figured things out before goldman or jpm not a

1,the problem i see is that putin isnt at the head of a gigantic empire losing influence hes at the head of what used to be a gigantic empire that has lost its influence and economic standing russia has essentially become a regional power that happens to have nuclear missiles so they get to swing their dick a little more than they should but their ability to do is predicted entirely on brinksmanship and not pushing things too far and while putin has successfully used brinksmanship for awhile he definitely took more liberties than he should have and we should have drawn a hard line in the sand then and there at the end of the day the history is secondary empires fall rome fell the hre fell napoleons empire fell the british empire fell the us canada and australia all used to be british colonies alsacelorraine or at least significant parts of it has a good argument for being historically german instead of french knigsberg is the same with germany and poland but today is kaliningrad in russia borders change historical territory can be lost or change hands and demographics can shift over time ukraine has done more than enough to establish itself as an independent and sovereign nation regardless of how russia or putin feels about it its not about what used to be or what is right its about the state of the world today and the ability of those in power to enforce or maintain it countries need to recognize when the axes of global power have realigned and where their place is and putin has fundamentally failed to do so since the fall of the berlin wall western influence has been inexorably creeping east over germany austria poland romania czechia slovakia etc and it continues to do so over ukraine whose pre2014 borders also happen to sit on an enormous amount of critical natural resources putin could have steered russia towards cooperation or at least peaceful coexistence with the west and built russia back into a formidable globalized power but instead he choose animosity and isolation if he kept russia to itself thats fine but the western world can only tolerate the violation of other nations sovereignty for so long when those nations or regions are economically or strategically important to us putin strikes me as someone who either cannot or refuses to recognize the realignment and new poles of global power he surrounds himself with yesmen and starts to believe a little too much of the ussresque nationalist russia propaganda hes pumping out for his people the culture of fear and sycophancy that he cultivated within the kremlin combined with the corruption endemic to russias politics and military further detached him from the reality of russias actual military power and global standing and imo this has made him all the more dangerous our tolerance of his previous incursions allowed him to view us as weak disorganized which i cant fully blame him for and this was our biggest mistake when i say hes an animal who only understands violence and force what i mean is that the only thing that will actually stop him from taking something he wants is if we physically prevent it the only power he truly seems to recognize is that of military projection and force our own inaction is what has allowed him to so drastically miscalculate the difference in power and resolve between russia and the west and now we are going to

here again looking at the dotcom crash if you bought spy at the absolute peak in 2000and never bought againyoud be even again 7 years later just in time for the great financial crisis four years after that in 2012 youd be back to even againbut if you held on after that youd be up 185 plus whatever dividends you got my point investing once at the absolute worst time in 2000 youd be up nearly 3x your money after 22 years again this is 3x your money for doing nothing if you want to include inflation youve still more than doubled your money investing at the worst time and doing nothing so how does this help you well simply if your goal is long term you dont have to worry so much because youre not going to invest just once and then never again and because youre investing again and again over time you dont have to worry that every time you invest will be the worst time some of those times you invest will be better than others but over the decadesas history showsthe good times should outnumber the bad if your time horizon is shorter you should consider the dotcom crash scenario and think about how much it might hurt to be down another 40 and possibly not recover it for several years if you have something you want to spend big on in the next year two years you want to be cautious in any kind of market bull or bear the caveat here is im talking about broad index funds stocks

years never to recover their former glory this is why now in what looks like the beginning of a bear market that could last a while you see more speculative stocks and stocks of companies that dont make a profit or have strong cash flows selling off investors are ditching these stocks and moving safer places because they cant with high confidence bet that these companies will survive a downdraft
