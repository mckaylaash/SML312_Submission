Social media platforms, specifically public online forums like Reddit in the U.S. and Eastmoney Guba in China, have become significant sources of market sentiment, playing influential roles in shaping investor behavior and market movements. A key distinction between Western and Chinese markets lies in the ability to short-sell, with the U.S. market allowing this strategy and China maintaining a long-only structure. Short selling, often associated with market volatility, has been linked to market crashes, and U.S. legislators have occasionally banned the practice to restore economic stability. Previous studies have indicated that in China’s long-only market, positive sentiment on online forums correlates with immediate market returns, while negative sentiment shows little to no effect, suggesting that China's long-only market structure may play a role in limiting the impact of negative sentiment (e.g. Xinjie Wang and Zhiqiang Xiang, 2022, Ge Yu, 2021). This paper outlines a framework for forecasting U.S. stock movements by analyzing sentiment from Reddit comments in the ‘Stocks’ subreddit in 2022. By applying Natural Language Processing to classify and categorize sentiments, as well as drawing from Mohamed Al Guindy's The Social Internetwork to establish relationships, the machine learning model will predict stock performance. This study seeks to explore how online market forum sentiment influences stock movements, and whether the market structure of a nation affects the significance of positive versus negative sentiment.
