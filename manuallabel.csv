4676,i dont even think fsd should be a thing this whole idea that tesla is a tech stock and not a industrial stock is like saying industrial companies dont innovate fsd is way off with regulationteslas tech is with batteries and charger stations
4331,fair points i agree that se expanding beyond sea is a risky move since they couldve just focused on sea which is still largely untapped but seeing how well theyre doing in brazil might also mean that they have a team that can understand regional consumer patterns well but yes if i had a say i would much rather to have them focus on making business in sea profitable first before expanding beyond but tbh theres really no match for them in sea i know people from the region and its closest competitor lazada is constantly losing market share to them on abnb the brand itself is the moat people will say lets book an airbnb instead of lets book a homestay its just like people tend to say just google it instead of lets search it up on a search engine as long as the overall user experience improves both for the guest and host i think they will continue to grow but yes of course its not cheap on sq whats wrong with jack dorsey i have never really dig deep about him besides listening to earnings call mind elaborating seems like many people has something against him just like mark zukerberg
1862,riling up ukraine with empty promises of joining nato just to slam the door in their face once russia answers sad to see another person fall hook line and sinker for this slick propaganda that has been going on for years just sad im no newcomer to global geopolitics and also history my reddit comments and posts are there for anyone
2653,btw there is no way the cyber truck can sustain such a low price unless its just a metal box on wheels
4807,i can not speak generally to other stocks like att never held it i had a watchlist that i started in 2020 and made a duplicate then kept updating the original the businesses that just bloated their debt dont seem to be running well on fundamentals anymore these were all value stocks in 20192020 i used the screener at finviz plenty of well performing businesses paid down their debts during 2020 and refinanced what they had left instead of taking on more debt remember you dont need a stock to become the next amzn to make you solid returns over the years
2985,they arent doing anything groundbreaking youre gonna regret that when everyone lives in the metaverse but youre banned from it for this comment
1612,it is a pump and dump not a long term investment if you got in early good for you if you trying to buy in now have a stop loss stock is 100m market cap so it doesnt take much to pump it is why youtubers and wsb target it notice how the pumpers never mention the financials
4769,why are they delaying electric that makes no sense at all lol so youre saying only tesla can sell electric cars nobody else is selling you realize some of their current model on sale are the most popular sold but not all of them right
5391,ill never get the gme hate is a large portion of the sub financially illiterate conspiracy theorists yeah so what gme is not only an interesting buy bc of shitbrained moass theories about 10mshare its an interesting buy bc they have a determined leadership team strong shareholder base growing sector to make money in and are not worth a lot rn obviously citadel is not dumping spy to stay solvent on gme but the morons of the sub should not make every other part of the investment opp worthless is it a relatively risky investment yeah but i dont see a huge difference between betting on gme versus other growth stocks with sky high pes or companies like dkngpltrsq etc a lot of good companies have dropped by similar amounts as gme over the past few months pypl meta nflx
2259,you hit every one of my picks aapl isnt a tough choice people are glued to their smart phones look at what the teens have and want there will be some device that you need to access the internet and aapl will dominate that space
811,the dip left us behind lol i want to buy more nvda for 220
3740,amd has a long track record of hyping up products only in the last couple of years have they delivered maybe give it some more time for them to gain similar credibility as nvda etc yeah back when multicore cpus were first becoming a thing amd was screaming from the rooftops about how they had a 6core cpu the problem is the intel 2 and 4 core chips absolutely smoked it in benchmarks and real world application amd has had a great couple of years but its going to take time before their overhype under deliver reputation wears off
1468,if covid was what we all thought it was then yeah we would have kept crashing it wasnt though if youre suggesting this invasion is nothing like the media is portraying and sanctions will be lifted in a month and russia and usa will become best friends then yeah buy this dip up the one and only question you all need to ask yourselves is what is truly happening in ukraine is putin crazy or has he calculated this out does he want to backpedal but cant are things going according to his plan has he prepared for these sanctions the truth of whats going on there is the trillion dollar question focus your time and energy there and especially stay off rstocks
1261,whenever i see that ticker mentioned i check it as i remember it got hyped on pennystocks a lot seems to be a good example of great company shit stock theyre building market share and executing their business plan but the dilution to achieve it is slowing growth and the stock price is just stuck in the doldrums could be a contender to be big in the future or get bought out if legalisation hits
4152,the detail i would need to get into for this is beyond my attention span right now after studying currencies and empires for 5 years i would sum it up to the fall of all prior empires unlike ray dalio predicting the usa is in a current non reversible decline to china right now i would argue we are winning the information war the economic war and would win militarily with the help of nato and allies the past indicates that the final conflict to flip the switch on new reserve currency is a war between the current power and the upcoming power i dont believe the current world order can be flipped right now the reason for this is that the ww3 scenario is an inevitable armageddon therefore ww3 is not an option and if it is then global reserve currency will not matter it will be a story told on the rebuilding of mankind from the stone ages china cannot have global reserve currency without enforcing it no free person would ever chose that status quoe ahead china has no economy if not for us that may change and they may isolate or team with other undesirable societies based on dictatorship but that will not be sustainable as we have seen in the past the nature of that relationship just does not work since in essence they all want to be the only one in charge for now just focus on keeping elections clean and closing the wealth gap in america free world the rest will work itself out
263,my parents gave me 5k to invest in 2012 as i was trading daily on mock websites with fake money couldnt trade 5k reasonably with 10 trade fees so dumped it all into nflx it still represents an astonishing amount of my portfolio but the past 3 months have been a bit of a mental struggle to get past the fact im still up hundreds of thousands
3133,analysts at the end of last year buy safe bluechip stocks fb err no jpm lol
1886,ugh bag holder here comments like this are making me want to accept my losses however long term sports gambling is gonna be huge so dk is a high risk high reward play if they can survive the early stages when competition is fierce than they will be a golden ticket for share holders idk if they will or if itll bet mgm cesars penn im gonna keep holding my ticket and see what happens its not a corner stone of my portfolio
